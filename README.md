## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- MongoDB (local or cloud instance)
- pnpm (recommended) or npm

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd donatechain
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   # or
   npm install
   ```

3. **Environment Setup**
   
   Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory:
   ```env
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/donatechain
   JWT_SECRET=your-jwt-secret-key
   PORT=5000
   ```

4. **Start MongoDB**
   
   Make sure MongoDB is running on your system:
   ```bash
   mongod
   ```

5. **Run the development servers**

   Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   cd server
   node index.js
   ```

   In a new terminal, start the frontend:
   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   # or
   npm run dev
   ```

6. **Access the application**
   
   Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

### Database Seeding

The application automatically seeds the database with sample data on first run if the database is empty. This includes:
- Admin user account
- Sample donors and volunteers
- Example donations and tasks
